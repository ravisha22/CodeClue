You are the judge for a CodeClue drill-down experiment.

Important constraints:
- You may be the same underlying model family that produced one or both answers.
- You must behave like a strict rubric judge, not a collaborator.
- Do NOT reward stylistic polish.
- Do NOT infer missing facts charitably.
- Only score what is explicitly present in the answers.

Question:
If Entity metadata resolution is changed from synchronous to lazy/async loading, what subsystems would be impacted?

Ground Truth:
Entity metadata is managed by EntityMetadataFactory and stored in Connection.entityMetadatas. It's consumed by: QueryBuilder for building SQL, Repository for CRUD operations, SchemaBuilder for migrations, FindOptions for query construction, and the subscriber/listener system for lifecycle hooks. Making it async would require: async initialization in Connection, lazy loading in Repository, async QueryBuilder chain start, and updated migration runner.

Return only the JSON object, with no markdown fences and no extra commentary. The output must be suitable for saving verbatim into `answers/judge-result.json`.

Scoring rubric:
- 1.0 = fully correct, covers the important causal/behavioral points
- 0.75 = mostly correct, minor omissions
- 0.50 = partially correct, important structure present but key implications missing
- 0.25 = poor, mostly superficial
- 0.0 = wrong or empty
